# Python Data Types and Structures Used in `midterm/motion_track.py`

## Standard Python Data Types and Structures:
- **String**: Used for specifying paths, text on images, column names in pandas DataFrame, etc. (`'700006260959'`, `text1`, file name `'data_vib1.csv'`, etc.)
- **Integer**: Used for loop ranges, dimensions, indices, font thickness, etc. (`45`, `5000`, `10000`, `700`, `25`, etc.)
- **Float**: Used for more precise numbers, like the result of time calculations (`start_time`, `end_time`, `del_time`).
- **List**: Used to collect `x` and `y` coordinates, and frame processing times (`x_cord`, `y_cord`, `fps_time`).
- **Boolean**: Used to enable settings (`True` in `AcquisitionFrameRateEnable.value = True`).
- **Dictionary**: Used for constructing pandas DataFrame (`{'x_cord': x_cord, 'y_cord': y_cord, 'del_time': del_time}`).

## numpy Library:
- **numpy array**: Utilized for image and matrix operations (`kernel`, `frame`, `fg_mask`, etc.). Specific data types like `np.uint8` are used for arrays to define their precision and limits.
  
## OpenCV Library (cv2):
- Most OpenCV functions use and return numpy arrays, but it's worth mentioning OpenCV's own data types are implicitly used in the form of image arrays (`frame`, `fg_mask`, etc.), and structures for contours.

## neoapi Library:
- This is specific to camera operations, and while the explicit data types aren't listed, it's evident that objects (`camera`, `img`), methods, and properties (`Connect`, `ExposureTime.Set`, `GetImage`, `GetNPArray`) are used, which internally could be utilizing various data types like strings, integers, etc.

## pandas Library:
- **DataFrame**: A key pandas structure for data manipulation and storage (`df`), created from dictionaries and capable of being exported to various formats like CSV.
- **Series**: Although not explicitly mentioned by name, Series are the building blocks of DataFrames, representing columns.

## Other:
- **Function**: Defined with `def main()`, a construct to encapsulate and execute the described functionality.
- **Comments and Docstrings**: Used for documentation (`"""Main method of the program."""` and inline comments).

This script is a complex integration of different libraries and their data types, primarily operating on images from a camera, processing them, and finally saving the results into a CSV file.
